This is a user space multiplexer for GSM according to the
GSM 07.10 specification. Right now it contains some hardcoded
paths for the Openmoko Neo devices, it should work with all
kinds of modems that understand the +CMUX operation mode.

Please send patches to smartphones-standards@lists.linuxtogo.org

See src/gsm0710muxd.c for how to use it.

Although gsm0710muxd has dbus system bus activation support, for now
you need to start it manually because it expects the -x parameter
(path to GSM power and reset sysfs nodes).
